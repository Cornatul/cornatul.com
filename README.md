# LzoMedia Portfolio Website

#### This is the source code for the LzoMedia portfolio website.

This is a minimalistic portfolio website built with Gatsby and Cloudflare Pages. 
Using Cloudflare Pages, we can deploy our website in a matter of seconds and never pay for hosting.

## Installation

1. Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. Once installed, you can begin developing your site.

   ```sh
   cd lzomedia.com
   gatsby develop
   ```

3. By default, the Portfolio Minimal Starter has a `content` directory at the root of your Gatsby site. There, you can edit the theme settings as well as add content for your sections. To learn more about it, have a look at the [Readme of Portfolio Minimal](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal/tree/main/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal#readme).
