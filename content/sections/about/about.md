Hello there! I'm Stefan, a software developer from Romania currently living in United kingdom with a passion for building enterprise applications. I've been in the game for over 13 years now, and let me tell you, I've seen some things. But nothing gets me more excited than tackling a client's problem head-on and choosing the best programming language to get the job done.


I mean, who doesn't love a good challenge, right? It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube, but with code. And let me tell you, after staring at lines of code for hours on end, sometimes a puzzle is exactly what I need to shake things up and get my brain going again.


But don't let my love for puzzles fool you - I take my work seriously. I believe that every project is an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer, and I always strive to deliver the best possible solution to my clients. Whether it's with PHP, Python, or some other programming language, I'm always up for a good challenge and a chance to flex my coding muscles.


So if you're looking for a developer who's not afraid to roll up their sleeves and dive headfirst into a coding problem, look no further. I'm your guy (or gal, if you prefer). Let's tackle your next project together and see what we can accomplish!
